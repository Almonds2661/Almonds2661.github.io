    <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to Brody Crawford's Portfolio</h1>
    <h2 class="text-left">About Me</h2>
    <p>Greetings, my name is Brody, and I am a second-year student at Computer Systems Technology at Saskatchewan
        Polytechnic. I have experience in the IT field and aspire to make programs that help people in the business
        world. I have experience in several languages, web frameworks, operating and network systems,
        hardware and system management.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Projects</h2>
    <h3 class="text-left">AI Data Import</h3>
    <p>The project took in PDFs, Excel sheets, or CSV data and with AI it mapped it to our clients database schema.
        instructor's supervision. The clients system used PHP as a framework, and it is what we used to serve the
        website. On the backend, it operated on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).</p>
    <p>This was a group project with a small group of students working under real world clients in Saskatoon under our
        The database utilized Doctrine, and Object Relational Model to map the data to our schema. The program would
        then display this data to the user before they imported it to the backend database.</p>

    <h3 class="text-left">Java FX Server / Client Program</h3>
    <p>This was a Java program that would run a multithreaded server that would wait for incoming connections using
        Server Sockets. It would use Java-FX as a GUI framework for the clients while reported feedback to the server
        via its console. It used abstracted "packets" for network transfers and future packets types can be added later
        in a modular fashion.</p>
    <p>The server would use threads to listen for packets then send those packets to the clients that would also have a
        threads listening for them. Clients would receive the packets and display messages. Clients could also leave and
        join without causing disruptions. They also used a JSON file for their name and display colors.</p>
