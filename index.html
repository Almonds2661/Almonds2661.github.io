    <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to Brody Crawford's Portfolio</h1>
    <h2 class="text-center">About Me</h2>
    <p>Greetings, my name is Brody, and I am a second-year student at Computer Systems Technology at Saskatchewan
        Polytechnic. I have experience in the IT field and aspire to make programs that help people in the business
        world. I have experience in several languages, web frameworks, operating and network systems,
        hardware and system management.</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">Projects</h2>
    <h3 class="text-center">AI Data Import</h3>
    <p>This was a group project with a small group of students working under real world clients in Saskatoon under our
        instructor's supervision. The clients system used PHP as a framework, and it is what we used to serve the
        website. On the backend, it operated on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).</p>
    <p>The project took in PDFs, Excel sheets, or CSV data and with AI it mapped it to our clients database schema.
        The database utilized Doctrine, and Object Relational Model to map the data to our schema. The program would
        then display this data to the user before they imported it to the backend database.</p>
